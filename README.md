# Ω 1.0 — Emergent Universe
Run the Big Bang from one quantum seed.

## Quick Start
[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jtmoore177/Omega-1.0/blob/main/Omega1.0.ipynb)

## What It Does
- One seed → spin foam spacetime
- Big Bounce → no singularity
- Inflation → flat universe
- CMB peaks → n_s = 0.964
- Black holes → S = A/4
- Gravitational waves → LIGO chirp

## Results
1M runs → our universe is #487,291 (n_s=0.9643, CMB peak=5512).
